Description:
Constructed a risk parity portfolio on 4 ETFs using equal risk contribution with Ledoit–Wolf covariance shrinkage, which improved the Sharpe ratio by ~0.5 and reduced drawdowns by ~9% compared to benchmarks.
Refined the model into a factor-exposure risk parity framework by applying PCA on 12 ETFs across 4 macro factors and solving a constrained optimization, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 2.74 vs. 1.72 equal-weight and lowering maximum drawdown from -7.2% to -2.8%.
